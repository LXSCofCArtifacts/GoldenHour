# GoldenHour

This application was created using Three.js which is a javascript 3D library. This application involves 3D object creation, ambient/directional light, texture mapping and animation. The scene involves the sun rising and setting over a field with trees and a golden throne(toilet). As the sun animates through the sky, the casted shadows from the trees and toilet move with the sun. You can also adjust the postion of the toilet.

To move the throne press 1,2,3 or 4 on the keyboard and then use the left and right arrow keys.
- Pressing "1" will rotate the bowl of the toilet.
- Pressing "2" will rotate the back rest of the toilet.
- Pressing "3" or "4" roates the handles of the toilet to signify flushing the toilet.

The name "GoldenHour" is used because it is protraying the perfect way to use the bathroom, in nature and under the sun.
